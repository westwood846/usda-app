# USDA App

> Name subject to change

Ionic/Angular app for searching the USDA food databank and displaying nutritional information of food items. Also has a collection function for calculating meal nutrients.

`ionic serve` for running a live-reloading development build in the browser. `ionic cordova emulate android` to run on an emulator. Add `--configuration=offline` to intercept live calls to the USDA API and return offline sample data instead. `npm run build_debug` to compile a debug build APK.
